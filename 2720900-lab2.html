            <p>
                Hi! I'm Lilimu Mualusi, and i'm currently wrappung up my final year as a computer science student at the University of Witswatersrand. 
                I've always had a passion for solving problems, and computer science has been the perfext way to channel that energy.
                The more I learn, the I realize how much there is to discover.
